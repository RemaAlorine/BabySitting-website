     You then are free to contact that babysitter as many times as required for further bookings.
     <p>The type of work for babysitting workers also varies from watching a sleeping child, changing diapers,
     playing games, preparing meals, to teaching the child to read or even driving (if the age is right).</p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p id="about">Founded in 2022,WeCare is born out of the desire to make it simpler for parents to
               find great babysitters. Parents eagerly came in droves to find trusted child care because WeCare's 
               'on-demand' booking made that so easy, and for part-time and 
               full-time care, when parents found caregivers they absolutely couldn't live without.
                Likewise, caregivers rushed to UrbanSitter to find their pick of flexible, well-paid jobs.
                 Along the way, we've listened intently to our customers' needs and met them, and in turn, we've
                  heard inspiring stories about how WeCare has changed life for the better, enabling a single mom 
                  to have "me time" or helping a sitter pay her way through life. Our mission is clear: WeCare is 
                  here to support families and caregivers so they can "say yes" to more in their lives , pursuing 
                  their choice of career, education, 
              family and self. Together, we are working toward a brighter future of unlimited possibilities.</p>
